# Sales Analytics Portfolio Project

## Overview
Analyzed a sample sales dataset (model cars, trains, planes — no forbidden products) to demonstrate skills across retail, finance, and tech industries.

Dataset: [Sample Sales Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data) (2,823 transactions, 2003-2005)

## Key Achievements
- Cleaned and normalized data into a relational SQLite database (Products, Customers, Orders)
- Built advanced SQL queries for business insights
- Performed RFM customer segmentation
- Created cohort analysis for retention tracking
- Visualized trends and segments using Python (matplotlib/seaborn)

## Business Questions Answered
1. Sales performance by product line and region → Classic Cars dominate in USA/Spain/France
2. Deal size drivers → Large deals concentrated in Q4
3. Top customers → Euro Shopping Channel leads with $912K revenue
4. Seasonal trends → Strong Q4 peaks every year
5. Scenario resilience → Diversification into Vintage Cars and Motorcycles recommended

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, sqlite3)
- SQL (complex joins, window functions, CTEs)
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
